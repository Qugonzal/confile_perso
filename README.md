My personnal config files for Vim &amp; others.

The file 'c.vim' in '.vim/syntax' should already exist in your VIMRUNTIME directory.
In Vim you can type ':echo $VIMRUNTIME' to know this directory.
You can use this c.vim file directly by copying it with the '.vim/' directory in your home directory.
Or you can just add the last section of this 'c.vim' file (between the lines of '*') in your own c.vim file.
